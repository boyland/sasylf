# Unification #

The Unification algorithm implemented in SASyLF is taken from:

Tobias Nipkow.  Functional Unification of Higher-Order Patterns.  Logic in Computer Science, 1993.

We found that paper to be one of the more readable introductions to higher order pattern unification.  A more recent presentation, which might be worth following more directly in a future, refactored implementation, is:

Jason Reed.  Higher-Order Constraint Simplification In Dependent Type Theory.  LFMTP 2009.
