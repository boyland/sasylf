judgment absurd: contradiction

judgment ok: u OK

---- ok-u

  exists contradiction.
  _: contradiction by induction on u:
    case u1 + v is
      _: contradiction by induction hypothesis on u1
    end case 
    case v * w is

and
lemma v-impossible:
  forall v
  exists contradiction.
  _: contradiction by induction on v:
