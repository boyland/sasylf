syntax

n ::= 0 | S n

judgment plus: n + n = n

--------- plus-z
0 + n = n

n1 + n2 = n3
---------------- plus-s
S n1 + n2 = S n3

lemma weird:
    forall p: S n1 + n2 = n3
    forall n4
    exists n1 + n2 = n4.
    proof by inversion of plus-s on p
end lemma

/*
theorem impossible:
    exists 0 + 0 = S 0 .
    p000: 0 + 0 = 0 by rule plus-z
    p101: S 0 + 0 = S 0 by rule plus-s on p000
    p001: 0 + 0 = S 0 by lemma weird on p101, (S 0)
end theorem
